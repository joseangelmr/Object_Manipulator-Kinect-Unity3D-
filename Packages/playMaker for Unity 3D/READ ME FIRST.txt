If you get a error that says: "There are inconsistent line endings in the '******.cs' script. 
Some are Mac OS X (UNIX) and some are Windows."  This is easily fixed.

Simply open the .cs file mentioned in the error (by double clicking on the console warning) and opening it
with Monodevelop. Once the file is open, simply type "// blank" (without the quotes) any where in the script and
click save. A popup will open asking if you want to "Convert" or not, click convert, and save. You can then erase
the "// blank" you added and click save again, and exit out of Monodevelop.  The error should be gone.
